**Announcements (Tuesday):**

1. Grades are updated.

    <img src=grades-lab.png>

    Reminder:
    1. It is better to submit a correct assignment late than an incorrect one on time.
        Very little partial credit will be awarded for incomplete/incorrect submissions.
    1. Once you submit in sakai, you cannot modify your assignments on github.

    Common errors:
    1. Not following instructions
    1. Not sanity checking intermediate steps
    1. Not applying knowledge from previous sections

    You will be seeing all of this material again... and again... and again.
    1. MapReduce HW
    1. Upcoming labs
    1. Data Science Capstone project (DS180)

    <img src=grades-quiz.png>

    Quiz Thursday
    1. 8 problems (4 POSIX II, 4 POSIX III)
    1. Expect them to be harder than last week
    1. Why? Bad shell commands ruin companies.
        1. [Toy Story 2 deleted due bad shell command](https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good)

    <img src=grades-overall.png>

    1. Very few overall points awarded so far
    1. My grading philosophy:
        1. I don't want 1 (or 2 or 3 or ...) bad days to ruin your grade
        1. I give lots of extra credit
            1. It's an alternative way to demonstrate you've mastered the material
            1. It's generally harder than the regular credit
        1. My goal is to give as many A's as possible, and have those A's actually mean something.

    1. Exams
        1. You'll have a combination of takehome and oral (one-on-one) exams

*Do the required pre-lab task for class on Thursday!*

**Announcements (Thursday):**

1. Quiz next week
    1. 8 problems (4 from git notes, 4 review)
    1. We will not cover git notes in class
    1. I recommend reviewing the CS46 unix/git tutorial: <https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046/blob/2023spring/topic_00_unix/git.md>

1. QCL Mentoring schedule posted: <https://www.cmc.edu/qcl/mentoring>

## Lecture Notes

1. Overview

    1. Docker used basically everywhere

       <https://stackshare.io/docker>

       <img src=docker-docker-everywhere.jpg width=400px />

    1. Why?
       
       1. Different computers have different versions of libraries
       1. So code that works on 1 computer won't necessarily work on another computer
       1. Docker containers let you deploy your code along with all the dependencies
       1. So if it works on any machine, it works on every machine

    1. Hard to learn
        1. Lots of different concepts that all work together

        1. You can't fully understand any concept until you understand all the concepts

           In this way it's like git/github... but on steroids

        1. It's okay if you don't 100% understand all of today's lecture;
           
           the next few lectures will build on this material, reviewing it and filling in gaps

        1. you have to use it to fully understand it... so labs/hws will be super important

       </a>

    1. https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/

       Helps you actually understand the commands below

1. Basic Commands

    1. `docker pull`: download a docker image

        important images include:

        1. `ubuntu`: a basic install of the ubuntu distro
        1. `debian`: a basic install of the debian distro
        1. `alpine`: a basic install of the alpine distro (most popular distro for containers due to extremely small size)
        1. `python`: an alpine container with latest python pre-installed

    1. `docker run`: creates and runs a new container

       automatically calls `docker pull` if needed

        1. `-it`: use this flag whenever you are running an interactive command (such as `bash`); the `i` stands for interactive and the `t` stands for tty

           (pronounced "eye-tee" not "it")
        1. `--name`: provide a name for the container that will be displayed with the `docker ps` command
        1. `--rm`: delete the container after running, useful for preserving disk space
        1. `-d` run as a daemon
        1. `-p X:Y`: expose port `Y` in the docker image to lambda server port `X`
    1. `docker ps`: lists currently running containers
        1. `-a`: list all containers (even those not running)
        1. `-q`: only print container ids
    1. `docker stop`: stop a container started with the `-d` flag
    1. `docker rm`: delete a stopped container that was not created with the `--rm` flag
        1. commonly called with the pattern
           ```
           $ docker rm $(docker ps -qa)
           ```
           to delete all containers
    1. `docker exec`: runs a command in a container without creating a new container
        1. `-it`: same as for `run`

1. Customization commands
    1. `docker build`: creates a new "container image"
        1. `-t`: name the image
    1. `Dockerfile`: a file describing the instructions for creating a new image

1. Debug/admin commands
    1. `docker image`:
        1. `rm`: remove a single image
        1. `prune`: remove ALL images
    1. `docker system`:
        1. `df`: report disk usage of docker
            
            all docker data stored in `~/.local/share/docker`
            1. a bit "hidden"
            1. counts towards your diskspace quota
    1. `docker logs`: shows `stdout` and `stderr` of all commands run without the `-it` flags; most commonly used on containers started with the `-d` flag
        1. `-f`: follow mode

<!--
1. Basic networking
    1. Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
        1. (Almost) every device on the internet has a unique IPv4 address.
           IPv4 uses 32bit addresses (looks like 134.173.191.241), which supports up to 4 billion unique addresses.
        1. The internet is slowly moving to the IPv6 standard.
           IPv6 uses 64bit addresses (looks like `fe80::3efd:feff:fedd:feec`).
        1. The IPv4 address `127.0.0.1` is called a "loopback" address because it always refers to the computer you are working on.
    1. TCP port numbers
        1. ports are numbers between 1 and 2^16-1 (65535)
        1. different services listen on different ports
        1. some standard ports are:
            1. ssh is 22
            1. http is port 80
            1. https is port 443
        1. notice that the lambda server is running ssh on a non-standard port,
           and that is why you must specify the `-p` flag when connecting
        1. only root can listen on ports < 1024;
           therefore, you cannot use the standard ports for your web services running on the lambda server
    1. port forwarding lets you redirect connections from one computer to another ([optional reference](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/example))

## Lab

**Optional Background Videos:**

<!--
1. [What is GNU+Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb2T8hWRu8g) by RMS

1. [MapReduce - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvhKoniK5Uo)
-->

1. [Virtual Machines vs Docker Containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvnZTi_gaNc)

1. [Docker vs Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s3h_GVzZc)

**Required Pre-lab Task:**

1. Install "rootless docker"

    Follow the instructions in the documentation: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#install>

    > **Warning:**
    > Many students do not read and follow the instructions in the output of the install command, and therefore do not have working installs.

    <!--
    1. Ensure that you:
        1. move the contents of the `bin` folder into `.local/bin`
        1. add the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to your `.bashrc` file
    
    1. Whenever the lambda server restarts, you must run the command
       ```
       $ systemctl --user start docker
       ```
       to restart the docker daemon.

**Instructions:**  Follow the instructions in the [lab-networking](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/lab-networking) submodule.

## Homework

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a popular framework for creating dynamic webpages in python.
The startup Runnable.com helps people deploy these webpages using docker.
They have a tutorial on developing dockerized flask apps at: <https://runnable.com/docker/python/dockerize-your-flask-application>.
For this homework, you will follow the tutorial and upload your completed app to github.

**Hint 1:**

The link above is now broken.
The company runnable.com has run out of business, and their website no longer works.
In order to view the instructions for the homework,
you will have to use the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/) to get access to an archived version.
[Most startups fail](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/startup-failure-stats),
and so it is common to use the wayback machine to reference documentation that has gone offline.

**Hint 2:**

These instructions were not designed for this class,
and you will therefore have to modify parts of the instructions in order to get them to work.
This is intentional in order to get you more practice adapting tutorials into different computational environments.
There are two main modifications you'll have to make:

1. In the `docker run` command, you will have to change the port that docker exposes to a port other than 5000.
   <!--
   (This is because you're all running this code at the same time, and you can't all use the same port.)
   I recommend using your user id as a port number, as this will guarantee that you don't run into conflicts with other students.
   Your userid is stored in the environment variable `$UID`.
   -->

1. In order to view your webpage from your laptop,
   you will have to connect to the lambda server with local port forwarding enabled.
   <!--
   The command will look something like
   ```
   $ ssh username@134.173.191.241 -p 5055 -L 8080:localhost:DOCKER_PORT
   ```
   where `DOCKER_PORT` is whatever port you specified.
   -->

**Hint 3:**

Finally, there's a handful of errors that you'll get when you build the project.
You'll find that fixing these errors only takes a very small change to the project files,
but figuring out exactly what this change is can be quite difficult.
You should very carefully read the contents of your error messages,
and perform good "sanity checks" between each step to ensure that you are progressing properly.

It is very common for realworld tutorials to not work exactly as written.
I've selected this tutorial specifically because it has these problems, and they are relatively minor.
It will give you good practice for when you encounter harder problems later.
<!--
The fundamental problem is that various libraries/packages have introduced breaking changes since the author of the tutorial wrote the tutorial.
The easiest way to figure out how to get the right versions is to open up a working container with the `docker run` command,
then manually try installing all the different versions of the libraries until you get something that successfully creates the webpage.
Once you've figured out the correct sequence of commands,
then you should modify the `Dockerfile` to reflect these new commands.
-->

**Submission:**

Put all your files for this homework into a github repo.
Also take a screenshot of your webpage and put it into the same repo.
Then upload the repo url to sakai.
